# SoFlow
This repository documents the **SOFLOW Project**, an end-to-end smart irrigation system design. It includes the full Bill of Materials (BOM), wiring and schematics, firmware structure, cloud integration, and safety protocols.   Instead of showing raw code, this README provides **previews and explanations** to guide you through implementation.
